Applying Kalman Filter to Rocket Altitude and Attitude Estimation

Purpose:
  Primary: To devise a robust filtering algorithm that will allow for accurate altitude estimation regardless of noise from the barometric altimeter.
  Secondary: To add attitude estimation to the original filter
  Tertiary: To add position estimation to the original filter
  Quatenary: To deal with non-linearities by implementing an Extended Kalman Filter using Jacobians to linearize around a point.
